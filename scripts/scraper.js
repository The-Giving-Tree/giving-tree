This file will be used to pull content from research posted online to:
1: create profiles for research organizations with dummy emails
2: pull latest research content
3: pull latest news

This script will maintain uniqueness but not replicating work (by keeping track of URLs and content similarilty)

The goal is to autopopulate the service so new users can see the site with more content.

Addendum: it would be great to start service organically first by posting articles by self to get a sense for how much real growth the platform has.
