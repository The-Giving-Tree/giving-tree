                Review the request’s details thoroughly to ensure you’ll be able to fulfill all

                Know that once you claim a request, you are committing to completing it. Should you

                  <li>
                    Asking questions where necessary, so that you know exactly what the requester

                If your requester can only reimburse you with cash, make sure that the cash exchange
                complies with social distancing regulations. Discuss whether you will need to supply
                exact change, or whether the remaining amount will be gifted to you as a tip. Please
                understand that any tips are entirely voluntary, and up to the requester’s

                  <li>
                    Wear gloves if possible. Be mindful of cross-contamination while wearing gloves,

                    When coughing and sneezing, cover your nose and mouth in the crook of your elbow{' '}

                  <li>

                  <li>
                    If possible, sanitize any packages you’ve picked up before delivering them to

                    It is extremely important that there is no physical contact between helpers and

                Remember that ordinary citizens are braving COVID-19 on your behalf, and try to
                create as few requests as possible so that you’re not sending multiple people out to
                multiple stores on your behalf. Instead, consolidate your asks into one request, and
                try to think of ways your helper could procure your needs from a single destination
                (e.g. Fred Meyer, Safeway).
                <br />
                <br />
                Help your helpers feel safe. Please don’t ask them to breach social distancing to
                hand-deliver your goods, or to exchange cash or other items.

              <b>Q: Do I have to pay to use this website?</b>
              <br />
              No, these services are provided entirely for free by a community of volunteers -
              ordinary people who have signed up to brave the risks of COVID-19 on your behalf.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Q: What kinds of things can we ask for?</b>
              <br />
              The Giving Tree can be used to request grocery and supply deliveries, food and supply
              donations, and other services you may need help with. You can ask for items such as
              groceries, toiletries, or other essential items. You can also ask for services
              relating to essential household functions (i.e. plumbing, appliance repair). We ask
              that you do not use The Giving Tree for self-promotion purposes unrelated to community
              welfare. Learn more about our Community Guidelines here.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Q: How do I pay my helper for purchases they’ve made on my behalf?</b>
              <br />
              If your request will require your helper to make purchases on your behalf, you should
              coordinate with your helper to determine how to reimburse them. Because exchanging
              cash may require you to breach social distance, we encourage you to use a contactless
              method to send your helper money, like PayPal, Venmo, or another e-transfer method.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Q: How do I make sure I am reimbursed for purchases I make? </b>
              <br />
              The Giving Tree works on a trust basis, and will not accept liability for the actions
              of our users. Please coordinate with the request’s requester beforehand, and use your
              best judgment when deciding whether you feel comfortable making purchases on behalf of
              the requester prior to reimbursement. We strongly recommend that helpers and
              requesters iron out payment arrangements and other details over a phone call, instead
              of over text. As we are working to build a community based on trust, we are putting
              our faith in our users to uphold common values like trust, honesty, and social
              responsibility.

              <b>Q: What does Karma mean? How do I improve it?</b>
              <br />
              Karma is The Giving Tree’s social currency -- the more involved you are in your
              community, the more Karma you collect. You can gain Karma in several ways: being
              upvoted for fulfilling help requests in your community, referring new users to The
              Giving Tree, and completing onboarding requests when you create your account.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Q: Do I have to share my home address with helpers?</b>
              <br />
              No, you can set a drop-off location anywhere that is publicly accessible, but we
              stress that you should abide by CDC’s{' '}

              if you are meeting a helper/picking up items in a public setting.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Q: Do I have to share my real phone number?</b>
              <br />
              No, you can use your email address or a social media account to communicate with other
              users. However, please ensure that whichever medium you use is one you check
              consistently, and has your real full name and photos of you, as this helps establish
              trust with the other users you’re communicating with. Please be respectful to the
              people you are helping, or who are helping you!
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Q: Am I eligible to ask for help?</b>
              <br />
              Our only requirement is that helpers and requesters be 16 years of age or older. As
              long as you adhere to our Community Guidelines, anyone who is over the age of 16 and
              feels they need help can request it.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Q: How do you screen helpers?</b>
              <br />
              As it stands right now, we allow anyone over the age of 16 to sign up for The Giving
              Tree, and allow people of all ages to view its public posts. We strongly recommend
              that you use your discretion and common sense when interacting with other users, and
              that you refrain from providing/accepting help when you do not feel comfortable.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are working on methods to have users verify their identity using reliable social
              media accounts. We want to make The Giving Tree widely accessible, but it is also
              extremely important to us to keep our community safe from scamming and exploitation.

              If you haven’t already, please ensure you complete your profile by adding your photo
              and other information. Providing real details on who you are can help instill trust

              Yes, but only if you have confirmed that the person you are participating on behalf of

              <br />
              Oh no! Your Karma may have decreased because someone downvoted one of your help
              requests. This may have been an accident, or it may be because your request violates
              one of our Community Guidelines. Please make sure to review the guidelines, and edit
              or delete your post to better comply with them.

              Thank you for your interest! Since our project is very new, we need all the help we
              can get. There are several ways to help us out -- the simplest being providing us
              feedback using the Give Feedback! button in the platform’s lower right-hand corner
              (desktop). Additionally, you can email us to share your thoughts on how we can
              improve, or to express interest in joining our team.
