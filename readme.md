# The Giving Tree

This is the express backend to `The Giving Tree`.

This app is designed to be a p2p network connecting people who need help and people who have resources to help.

We will initially launch with just food/water provisions, beccause these are essential to life.

We are integrating postmates, ubereats, amazon fresh, costco, walmart APIs and more to make it easier to help.

After we launch this, we will assist with other items, such as shelter, transportation, household supplies/toiletries and more.

People can receive `karma` for helping others and we can see how much "good" we as a community have done for others; like paying it forward.

## Future Plans
Please consider joining our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/the-giving-tree-group/shared_invite/zt-cw3mwl2t-_GhiTvCIUXvz65uirlSSCA) if you have any notion of helping. Everyone and anyone helps!

We hope to release an iOS/Android app in addition to this web interface, and add in Stripe integrations for payment processing. Feedback always appreciated.
